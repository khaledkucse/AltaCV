RE: Software Developer\\

Dear Hiring Manager,\\
\hfill\break
Upon learning about the Software Developer posting with Fortinet from my friend Shubhra Prakash Sarkar who is Jr. Software(Game) Developer, Fortinet, I am eager to contact you with my interest. When reviewing the job description, responsibility, and qualifications, I am excited to see how well my experience and skill set align with your company's needs and position requirements. From reading your company's website, I feel your core mission and culture suit what I offer as a professional.\\
\hfill \break

As a huge fan of Fortinet, I am excited to see this posting for a Software Developer. I feel like I'm a great match for the job and a great fit for your organization.\\
\hfill \break

As an adept Software Engineer at the University of Saskatchewan, I have a well-rounded skill set in Software Development in Linux Environment and honed talents in object oriented language such as Java or Python, network concepts and architecture such as TCP/IP, and distributed network computing, making me an ideal fit for the Software Developer position. Further, I am a recognized expert in teamwork and a communicative collaborator. My previous roles have strengthened my capabilities in leadership and critical thinking, including keen attention to detail and accuracy.\\
\hfill \break

I am excited at the prospect of bringing my talents to Fortinet. I look forward to hearing from you, at your earliest convenience, to discuss how my experience and qualifications will prove valuable in the Software Developer role. Just to let you know I will move to Vancouver, BC by own expense if given the chance to work with Fortinet.\\

Sincerely Yours,\\
